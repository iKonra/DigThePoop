-- SetupModules placeholder
-- This script previously tried to copy local development modules into ReplicatedStorage at runtime.
-- That approach caused issues in Studio because local project folders are not available at runtime.
-- Keep this script as a harmless placeholder. To use TutorialClient on clients, place the
-- ModuleScript directly under ReplicatedStorage.GameModules.Client in Studio.
print("SetupModules placeholder loaded — no runtime copying performed.")
